# My Python Scripts ðŸš€

Hey there! Welcome to my repo where I've been playing around with Python scripts. It's just a bunch of scripts I've thrown together while exploring the ins and outs of coding. From messing with files, to pretending I'm a hacker by checking system stats and pinging servers, it's all here.

## What's Inside?

- **File Shenanigans**: I've got scripts to poke around files because, why not?
- **Web Stuff**: Making requests and grabbing data from the web because it makes me feel powerful.
- **Spying on My Computer**: Not really, but checking disk usage and stuff makes me feel like I'm in control.
- **Network Ninja Moves**: Simple scripts to check if I can reach the world beyond my room.

Then clone the repo and have fun!

## That's All Folks!

Remember, this is just me having a blast and learning along the way. If you find something useful or want to share how to make it even better, hit me up!
Catch ya on the flip side! ðŸ¤˜
